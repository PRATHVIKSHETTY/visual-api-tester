The Visual API Tester &amp; Flow Designer combines the intuitive feel of flowchart-based tools with the power of API testing platforms like Postman. Users can create and connect API blocks (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), customize headers and JSON bodies, view real-time responses, and save reusable API flowsâ€”all within an interactive, node-based canvas.
